"""Hard-won constants for the Huginn extraction pipeline. Do NOT edit values blindly.

Every value here was fixed by debugging the MVP notebook (notebooks/01_mvp_h2.ipynb) —
treat them as the "as-is" reproducibility guarantee.

GOTCHAS (kept verbatim from the notebook):
- transformers must be 4.50–4.53. Outside the window the custom modeling code breaks:
    4.49-  : no `device` in _get_initial_cache_position
    4.54+  : key_cache became a read-only property
    5.x    : tied-weights loading expects a dict
  Pin 4.53.3 + MODEL_REVISION — both mandatory.
- num_steps is a plain int, NOT a torch.tensor (len() of a 0-d tensor crashes forward).
- Hook `model.transformer.core_block[-1]`; `_forward_hooks.clear()` + try/finally, else a
  hook left by a crashed run doubles the captures.
- h_0 is a RANDOM init (torch.manual_seed before forward): it is an outlier, so winding is
  measured with a burn-in that drops the initial arc.
- For a trajectory use forward, NOT generate.
